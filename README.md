# CSI TechTree
 Cruesoe Space Industries Technology Tree


All credit to SpinkAkron and theOneGalen for the work on UnkerballedStart that I forked to make my own personal version.  Another credit to Heamec for the wonderful Icons I have used that were originally created for Kiwi Tech Tree, used with permission.

My fiddling around has resulted in this.  The Cruesoe Space Industries Tech Tree! (fanfare).

This is a Tree with UnKerballedStart as its core that I intend to feed and water and see what grows.

Over the past few days I have gone completely blind looking at the parts and I know how the Kerbal Community love to share thoughts on part balance so have at it.

One of the suite of products I am keen to add properly is USI Constellation, all of them, as I feel it doesn't get enough love sometimes.  So any players of USI, especially MKS and WOLF come back to me!

I'm new to using GitHub to store projects so if I make any obvious mistakes in ettiquite or protocal please let me know.

This post is merely to share a very new project, get some discussion going and keep myself motivated to 'finish' (can you ever finish a mod?)

Enjoy.
